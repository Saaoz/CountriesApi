# Countries API


Small React project where I use the countries API to highlight the differences with a choice of settings by quantity and by continent.

For the API, I used axios to make my request.

It displays some information about the country.

The "About" page doesn't serve any specific purpose, it was just used for navigation practice.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`
